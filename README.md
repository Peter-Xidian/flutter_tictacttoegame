# flutter_tictacttoegame
I'll be developing mini apps that would reinforce my lessons through my flutter journey. First one is a game called Tic-tac-toe. Fun fact, As a teen at Lakeside Prep School, Bill Gates wrote his first computer program on a General Electric computer. It was a version of tic-tac-toe where you could play against the machine.
